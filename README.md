# Ground Control System (GCS)

## Description

The Ground Control System (GCS) allows users to assign missions to one or more drones through a simple menu interface. A mission consists of structured tasks — TAKEOFF, MOVE, ACTION, and LAND — executed automatically in sequence. Users create missions step-by-step by entering coordinates and actions, then assign them to a drone swarm. Once started, drones execute commands autonomously while the system tracks mission status in real time and generates a report after completion or abortion.
