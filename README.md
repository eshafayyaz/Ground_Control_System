# Ground Control System (GCS)

## Basic Description

This Ground Control System allows users to assign missions to one or more ground drones. A mission is basically a set of commands that the drone executes automatically. The user creates a mission by defining steps like moving to a location, taking pictures, or landing at a point. Once the mission starts, the drone follows these commands on its own without manual control at every step. The user does not need to control the drone at every step.
